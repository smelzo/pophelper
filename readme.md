##PopHelper
PopHelper is a small plugin developed upon Bootstrap javascript library.
It's similar to Bootstrap's PopOver but with some different features
- the PopOver content can be loaded from an external document ...
- or can be used a DOM element in same page
- the PopOver is closed by click on other part of page (not only on toggler element ad PopOver)

As it's name suggest, PopHelper can be useful for wide helps for form element, or also to show any kind of markup (forms , lists, images etc.) by clicking on an element.
